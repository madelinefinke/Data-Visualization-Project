# Data-Visualization-Project
The Bachelor franchise is a popular American reality television franchise. In the show, contestants vie to win the love of an eligible bachelor or bachelorette with the goal of ending up engaged. This mini project sources its data from Rachelle Perez’s The Bachelor vs. Bachelorette dataset on Kaggle. The dataset contains data from seasons 1-24 of The Bachelor and 1-16 of The Bachelorette and does not include analysis of any of The Bachelor spinoff series. This project aims to analyze trends in the two main Bachelor series among the variables of contestants’ age and relationship outcomes.
